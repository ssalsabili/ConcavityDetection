# ConcavityDetection

The Top-hat transform is used to develop a computationally efficient curve-fitting approach to detect concavities in a contour using OpenCV Python. The concavity detection is utilized to detect candidate regions containing touching villi and enhance the overall segmentation performance by further processing of the candidate regions.
